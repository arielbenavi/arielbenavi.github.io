## About Me

I'm Ariel Ben Avi, a Computer Science-Math student at Columbia University with a strong passion for software engineering, data collection/analysis, and quantitative finance. My journey spans from serving as a Cyber Security Intelligence Analyst in Unit 8200 of the Israeli Defense Forces to developing data pipelines and automation tools in the private sector.

As a Data Engineer at ActiveFence, I designed and implemented ETL pipelines using Python, SQL, and Apache Spark, enhancing real-time data ingestion by 20%. Previously, as a Software Developer, I led the development of automated research tools, boosting lead generation by 350% and improving counter-terror content moderation accuracy by 40%.

Beyond industry experience, I’m deeply involved in personal projects, such as an automated Bitcoin wallet tracking system that monitors high-value wallets and a lead generation CLI tool that reverse-engineers APIs to extract valuable insights. I also have experience teaching and mentoring, having led training programs in the Israeli Defense Forces.

My technical expertise includes Python, C, Java, SQL, and cloud platforms like AWS. When I’m not coding, I enjoy analyzing financial markets. Feel free to check out my [GitHub](#) for my latest projects or connect with me on [LinkedIn](#).
